# Geogiga Seismic Pro: A Powerful Software for Near-Surface Seismic Methods
 
Geogiga Seismic Pro is a comprehensive software package that provides leading tools for near-surface seismic methods, such as reflection, refraction, surface wave, and borehole seismic. It is designed for geophysicists, geologists, engineers, and researchers who are involved in exploration, engineering, environmental, and mining projects.

Geogiga Seismic Pro consists of 23 standalone modules that cover the entire workflow of seismic data processing and interpretation. Users can easily switch between different modules without interrupting their workflow. The modules are highly interactive and intuitive, allowing users to have full control over the data processing procedure and to adjust parameters on the fly. The software also incorporates state-of-the-art techniques and fast algorithms that produce high-quality results and reveal the subsurface structures.
 
Some of the features of Geogiga Seismic Pro are:
 
- Reflection: Efficiently process reflection data in one application with multistep redo and undo. A feature-rich application for processing single-fold seismic reflection or GPR data is also available.
- Refraction: Highly interactive first-break picking and automatic phantom to derive layered velocity structures with GRM. Estimate subsurface velocity structures with efficient first-break picking and fast shortest path ray tracing in 2D or 3D.
- Surface Wave: Efficiently process active surface wave data using MASW and SASW with GA inversion. All-in-one application for efficiently processing active and passive surface wave data with MASW, REMI, SPAC, and ESPAC. Interactive rendering of 3D volume built from velocity profiles in a survey area.
- Borehole Seismic: Efficiently derive velocity structures among vertical or deviated wells with fast and robust ray tracing. Efficiently process zero-offset or offset VSP data. Interactive simultaneous processing of P-wave and S-wave data for downhole velocity surveys.
- Utilities: Preprocess seismic data with various functions, such as resampling, vertical stacking, nodal data assembling, trace swapping, and format conversion. Plot 3D fence diagram for all velocity or seismic sections in a survey area. Interactively determine velocity and thickness of a layered model by fitting T-X curves with refraction and reflection events. Simulate surface waves, refracted and reflected waves for a layered velocity model with analytic solutions or elastic full-wave modeling.

Geogiga Seismic Pro is developed by Geogiga Technology Corp., a company that has been dedicated to geophysics software research and development since 1994. Geogiga has thousands of clients from more than 70 countries around the world. Geogiga also offers two other software packages: Microseismic Pro for microseismic monitoring and RImager for resistivity and induced polarization tomography.
