SIR2 is a native audio-plugin that allows you to apply high-quality reverberation effects to your audio tracks. It is compatible with the plugin formats VST and AudioUnit, and it works on both Windows and Mac platforms. SIR2 uses convolution to process the audio signals with impulse responses, which are recordings of real acoustic spaces or devices. SIR2 includes high definition impulse responses (HDIR) of real places produced by Pinguin, Hamburg, such as churches, theaters, studios, halls, and more. You can also import your own impulse responses in various file formats, such as WAV, AIF, FLAC, BWS, or OGG.

SIR2 offers zero-latency processing with low CPU consumption and non-destructive audio processing. You can adjust the parameters of the reverb effect, such as pre-delay, stretch, amplitude envelope, filter envelope, and EQ. SIR2 also features true stereo processing, which means that a stereo convolution takes place for every source channel (left and right). SIR2 has a simple and intuitive user interface that lets you easily browse and load impulse responses, as well as tweak the settings of the reverb effect.
 
SIR2 is a discontinued product that was replaced by SIR3, which has more features and improvements. However, you can still purchase SIR2 from the official website of SIR Audio Tools[^1^]. You will need a license key to activate the plugin after downloading it. SIR2 has a fair copy protection system that does not require a dongle or a challenge/response mechanism. You can also upgrade from SIR2 to SIR3 at a discounted price if you wish to use the latest version of the plugin.
 
SIR2 is a versatile and powerful reverb plugin that can enhance your audio tracks with realistic and high-quality reverberation effects. Whether you want to add some ambience to your vocals, guitars, pianos, drums, or any other instrument, SIR2 can help you achieve the sound you want. You can listen to some audio samples of SIR2 in action on the official website[^1^] or on SoundCloud[^2^] [^3^]. If you are looking for a reverb plugin that is easy to use, CPU-efficient, and sounds great, you should give SIR2 a try.

In this article, we will show you how to use SIR2 in your audio projects. We will cover the following topics:
 
- How to install and activate SIR2
- How to load and browse impulse responses
- How to adjust the reverb parameters
- How to use SIR2 with other plugins
- How to import and create your own impulse responses

## How to install and activate SIR2
 
To install SIR2, you need to download the installer from the official website of SIR Audio Tools. You can choose between the Windows version (v.2.4.14) or the Mac version (v.2.4.15). The installer is a zip file that contains the plugin files and a readme file with instructions. You need to extract the zip file and copy the plugin files to your plugin folder. The plugin folder location may vary depending on your host application and operating system. For example, on Windows, the default VST plugin folder is C:\Program Files\VstPlugins, and on Mac, the default AudioUnit plugin folder is /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components.
 
To activate SIR2, you need a license key that you can purchase from the official website. After purchasing the license key, you will receive an email with a link to download a license file. You need to copy the license file to the same folder where you installed the plugin files. The license file has the same name as the plugin file, but with a .lic extension. For example, if you installed the VST plugin file SIR2.dll, you need to copy the license file SIR2.dll.lic to the same folder.
 
Once you have installed and activated SIR2, you can launch your host application and load SIR2 as a plugin on your audio track. You should see a window with the SIR2 user interface and a message that says "SIR2 is ready". If you see a message that says "SIR2 is not registered", it means that the plugin could not find the license file or that the license file is invalid. In that case, you need to check that you copied the license file correctly and that it matches the plugin file.

## How to load and browse impulse responses
 
SIR2 comes with a collection of high definition impulse responses (HDIR) of real places produced by Pinguin, Hamburg. These impulse responses are stored in a folder called HDIR inside the plugin folder. You can access them by clicking on the "Browse" button on the top left corner of the user interface. This will open a file browser window where you can navigate through the HDIR folder and select an impulse response file. The impulse response files have a .sir extension and are named according to their category, such as Church, Hall, Studio, etc.
 
When you load an impulse response file, you will see its name displayed on the top of the user interface, along with some information about its length, sample rate, channels, and format. You will also see a waveform display of the impulse response on the bottom of the user interface. You can zoom in and out of the waveform display by using the mouse wheel or by clicking on the "+" and "-" buttons on the bottom right corner. You can also drag the waveform display left and right by holding down the mouse button.
 
You can audition the impulse response by clicking on the "Play" button on the bottom left corner of the user interface. This will play a test signal through SIR2 and let you hear how it sounds with the selected impulse response. You can adjust the volume of the test signal by using the slider next to the "Play" button.
 
You can also browse through different impulse responses by using the arrow buttons on either side of the "Browse" button. This will load the next or previous impulse response file in alphabetical order within the same folder. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to browse through impulse responses: Ctrl+Left Arrow for previous file, Ctrl+Right Arrow for next file, Ctrl+Up Arrow for parent folder, Ctrl+Down Arrow for subfolder.
 
## How to adjust the reverb parameters
 
SIR2 allows you to adjust various parameters of the reverb effect by using sliders and knobs on the user interface. These parameters are divided into four sections: Main, Envelope, EQ, and Misc.
  
The Main section contains the following parameters:
