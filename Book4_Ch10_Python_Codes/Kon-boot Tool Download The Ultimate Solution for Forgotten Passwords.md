## Step 1: Download Kon-boot Tool
 
The first step is to download Kon-boot tool from the official website[^1^]. There are two versions of Kon-boot: one for Windows and one for macOS. Depending on your needs, you can choose either the personal license or the commercial license. The personal license is cheaper but has some limitations, such as no online password bypass for Windows 10 and Windows 11, no secure boot bypass, and no ability to create a local admin account. The commercial license has more features and supports more operating systems, but it is more expensive. You can compare the features and prices of both licenses on the website[^1^].
 
After you purchase the license, you will receive an email with a link to download Kon-boot tool. The download file is a ZIP archive that contains an ISO image file. You will need to extract the ISO file from the ZIP archive using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
