## Step 1: Prepare Your USB Flash Drive
 
The first step is to prepare your USB flash drive with the files needed for the softmod. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Extract the Xbox Linux Ndure 02 07 08 By Hal9000 Eol Rarl package to a folder on your PC.
2. Open the folder and run the "XboxHDM.bat" file. This will launch a menu where you can choose different options.
3. Select option 1: "Build xboxhdm". This will create an ISO image file called "linux.iso" in the same folder.
4. Burn the "linux.iso" file to a blank CD-R or CD-RW disc using any burning software.
5. Insert your USB flash drive into your PC and format it to FAT32 if it is not already.
6. Copy the "ndure" folder from the Xbox Linux Ndure package to the root of your USB flash drive.
7. Eject your USB flash drive from your PC and insert it into your USB to Xbox adapter cable.

## Step 2: Hotswap Your Xbox Hard Drive
 
The next step is to hotswap your Xbox hard drive with your PC.
