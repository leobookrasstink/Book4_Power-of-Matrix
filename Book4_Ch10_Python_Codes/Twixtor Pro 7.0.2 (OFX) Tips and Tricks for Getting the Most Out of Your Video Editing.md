Twixtor Pro is a plugin that allows you to create stunning slow motion and time remapping effects in various video editing software. Twixtor Pro uses optical flow tracking to analyze the motion of pixels across frames and generate new frames that smoothly interpolate between the original ones. This way, you can slow down or speed up your footage without losing quality or introducing artifacts.

Twixtor Pro 7.0.2 is the latest version of the plugin that supports OFX hosts, such as DaVinci Resolve, Nuke, Scratch, Vegas Pro, and more. Twixtor Pro 7.0.2 also adds 360 video support, which means you can apply Twixtor to your spherical footage and preserve the continuity of the left and right sides, as well as the top and bottom. Twixtor Pro 7.0.2 is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.
 
If you want to take your video editing to the next level and create amazing slow motion and time remapping effects, you should definitely check out Twixtor Pro 7.0.2. You can download a free trial version from the official website[^1^] or purchase a full license for $595.

One of the key features of Twixtor Pro is its use of optical flow tracking to analyze the motion of pixels across frames. Optical flow is the motion of objects between consecutive frames of a video sequence, caused by the relative movement between the object and camera[^2^]. Optical flow can be used for various applications such as object tracking[^3^], motion detection, video compression, and human action recognition[^1^].
 
Optical flow tracking involves estimating the movement of pixels or features in the image, which can be done using different methods. Twixtor Pro uses the Lucas-Kanade (L-K) method, which is a sparse optical flow technique that tracks a set of points of interest in the image. The L-K method assumes that the motion of a small patch of pixels is constant and linear, and solves a system of equations to find the best fit motion vector for each patch[^4^]. This way, Twixtor Pro can accurately track the motion of objects and generate new frames that smoothly interpolate between the original ones.
 
Optical flow tracking is a powerful tool for creating stunning slow motion and time remapping effects, but it also has some limitations and challenges. For example, optical flow may fail when there are occlusions, illumination changes, or large displacements between frames. Moreover, optical flow may be computationally expensive and require hardware acceleration to achieve real-time performance. Twixtor Pro addresses these issues by providing various options and parameters to fine-tune the optical flow estimation and optimize the speed and quality of the output.

Twixtor Pro offers a user-friendly interface that allows you to adjust various options and parameters to control the optical flow estimation and the output quality. Some of the main options and parameters are:
 
- **Frame Rate:** This option allows you to set the desired frame rate for the output video. You can choose to use the same frame rate as the input video, or specify a different frame rate to achieve slow motion or time remapping effects. For example, if your input video has a frame rate of 30 fps and you set the output frame rate to 60 fps, Twixtor Pro will generate one extra frame between each pair of original frames, resulting in a smoother motion. Conversely, if you set the output frame rate to 15 fps, Twixtor Pro will drop every other frame, resulting in a faster motion.
- **Speed:** This option allows you to set the speed factor for the output video. You can choose to use the same speed as the input video, or specify a different speed factor to achieve slow motion or time remapping effects. For example, if your input video has a speed of 1x and you set the speed factor to 0.5x, Twixtor Pro will slow down the motion by half, creating a slow motion effect. Conversely, if you set the speed factor to 2x, Twixtor Pro will speed up the motion by twice, creating a time remapping effect.
- **Motion Sensitivity:** This parameter allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the optical flow estimation to the motion of objects in the image. You can choose a value between 0 and 100, where higher values mean more sensitivity and lower values mean less sensitivity. A higher sensitivity may result in more accurate tracking of fast-moving objects, but it may also introduce more artifacts and noise. A lower sensitivity may result in smoother tracking of slow-moving objects, but it may also miss some subtle motions.
- **Motion Vector:** This parameter allows you to adjust the length and direction of the motion vector for each pixel or feature in the image. You can choose a value between -100 and 100, where positive values mean longer and forward vectors and negative values mean shorter and backward vectors. A longer vector may result in more interpolation and smoother motion, but it may also introduce more distortion and blur. A shorter vector may result in less interpolation and sharper motion, but it may also introduce more jitter and flicker.

These are some of the main options and parameters that Twixtor Pro provides to help you create stunning slow motion and time remapping effects with optical flow tracking. You can experiment with different combinations of these options and parameters to find the best settings for your video footage and desired output.
