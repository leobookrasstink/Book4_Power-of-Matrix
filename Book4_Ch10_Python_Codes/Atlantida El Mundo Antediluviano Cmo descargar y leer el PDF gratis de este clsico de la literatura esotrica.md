## What is Atlantida El Mundo Antediluviano about?
 
The book is based mainly on Plato's account of Atlantis, which describes it as a large island that was ruled by a powerful and noble race of people. According to Plato, Atlantis was destroyed by a cataclysmic event that submerged it under the sea. Donnelly claims that Plato's story is not a myth or a moral allegory, but a historical fact that can be verified by various sources.
 
Donnelly's main thesis is that Atlantis was the cradle of civilization, the first place where humans evolved from barbarism to culture and society. He argues that Atlantis was a technologically advanced nation that colonized many parts of the world, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the Mississippi River, the Amazon River, the Nile River, the Pacific coast of South America (Incas), the Mediterranean Sea, Europe, Africa, the Baltic Sea, and the Black Sea. He also asserts that Atlantis is the true paradise on earth, the idyllic place that appears in all mythologies. For example, he identifies Atlantis with the Garden of Hesperides of the Cretans, the Elysian Fields of the Romans, the Olympus of the Greeks, the Asgard of the Norsemen, among others.
 
Donnelly also tries to prove that all major gods and goddesses from different cultures are derived from the Atlantean myths. He says that the great deities of Greece, Egypt, Scandinavia, Mexico and Peru are "free versions" of the real characters of history: the kings and heroes of Atlantis, assimilated and distorted by other cultures. He claims that among these "distortions" or interpretations, the mythology of the Egyptians and Incas is the one that best represents the religion of ancient Atlantis.
  
## What are some of the evidence used by Donnelly?
 
Donnelly uses a variety of evidence to support his theory of Atlantis. Some of them are:
 
- The similarities between languages, alphabets, symbols, customs, laws, arts, sciences and religions of different civilizations around the world.
- The presence of megalithic structures such as pyramids, temples, statues and monuments in various regions that show signs of common origin and design.
- The existence of legends and traditions that refer to a great flood or deluge that destroyed an ancient civilization.
- The discovery of fossils and artifacts that indicate a high level of civilization in remote times.
- The geological and oceanographic data that suggest changes in climate and sea level in prehistoric times.

## What are some of the criticisms and limitations of Donnelly's book?
 
Despite its popularity and influence in its time, Atlantida El Mundo Antediluviano has been widely criticized and rejected by modern scholars and scientists. Some of the reasons are:

- The lack of reliable sources and references for many of Donnelly's claims. He often relies on hearsay, speculation or outdated information.
- The selective use and interpretation of evidence to fit his preconceived idea of Atlantis. He often ignores or dismisses contradictory or alternative explanations.
- The tendency to generalize and exaggerate his findings without considering cultural diversity and historical context.
- The influence of pseudoscientific theories such as racialism, occultism and catastrophism that were prevalent in his era 8cf37b1e13
