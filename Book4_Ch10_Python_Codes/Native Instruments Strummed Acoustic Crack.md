Acoustic guitar is one of the most versatile and expressive instruments in music. It can add warmth, depth, and emotion to any genre, from rock to folk, from country to pop.

## What is Strummed Acoustic?
 
Strummed Acoustic is a Kontakt instrument that features a collection of patterns and chords played on a vintage Martin 0-17 steel-string guitar from 1934. This guitar has a warm, mellow tone that suits a variety of styles and genres. You can choose from over 160 patterns, ranging from simple strums to complex rhythms, with variations for different accents and grooves. You can also customize the performance with chord voicings, double-tracking, fret noise, and on-board effects.
 
Strummed Acoustic is designed to be easy and intuitive to use. You can play chords from your keyboard or use the auto-chord feature to automatically generate chords based on the key and scale you select. You can also use key switches, the mod wheel, and the pitch wheel to change patterns, crossfade voicings, and add accents in real time. You can even tap or play a rhythm on your keyboard to find the matching pattern in the library.
 
## How to Use Strummed Acoustic?
 
To use Strummed Acoustic, you need to have Kontakt or the free Kontakt Player installed on your computer. You can then load Strummed Acoustic as a standalone instrument or as a plug-in in your DAW of choice. Once you load Strummed Acoustic, you'll see the main interface, which consists of four sections: Pattern Browser, Sound Control Panel, Chord Selector, and Keyboard Layout.
 
The Pattern Browser lets you browse and select patterns by category, accent structure, time signature, tempo range, and musical attributes. You can also use the Tap Rhythm Finder to quickly find patterns that match your input rhythm. You can preview patterns by clicking on them or by pressing the keys on the lower part of the keyboard layout.
 
The Sound Control Panel lets you adjust the sound and mix of the guitar. You can add a doubled guitar part for extra width and depth, adjust the balance of high and low chord voicings, control the amount of fret noise for realism, and apply compression, EQ, and reverb effects.
 
The Chord Selector lets you choose between manual mode and auto-chord mode. In manual mode, you can play any chord you want from your keyboard or mouse. In auto-chord mode, you can select a key and scale from the drop-down menus and let Strummed Acoustic generate chords for you based on the pattern you choose. You can also edit the chords by clicking on them or by using the arrow keys.
 
The Keyboard Layout shows you how to control Strummed Acoustic from your keyboard. The lower part of the keyboard triggers patterns and endings. The upper part of the keyboard plays chords in different positions and inversions. The mod wheel controls the playing position on the neck (low or high). The pitch wheel controls the accent strength (soft or hard). The key switches let you change patterns on the fly.
